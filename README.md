# Blueberry Timer

Created with React.
An Pomodoro Timer clone. The default is set to 25 minutes, but users can pick any amount between 1-59 minutes. A blueberry doodle will dance when timer is done. There is also a mutable ding for a finished timer.

## Run on your machine

```
git clone https://github.com/brendaliu2/blueberryTimer.git
`npm start` set to port 3000
```


## Future Features to Add

* Thorough Testing
* Fix Bug when clicking pause and reset too many times, the timer starts to count down faster than one num per second
